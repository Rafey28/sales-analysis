# Sales Data Analysis & Visualization (Practice Project)

This is a **practice project** created to enhance my Python, data analysis, and visualization skills. I welcome **recommendations, suggestions, or constructive criticism** from the community to help me write cleaner, more efficient, and production-quality code.

## Overview
This project processes sales data from CSV files to derive insights such as total sales, average sales per product, and top-performing products. It generates professional visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line plots) to support data-driven decision-making. The dataset is expected to contain columns like product ID, sales amount, and date.

## Project Structure
- `data/`                  - Input data files (e.g., `sales_data.csv`)
- `output/`                
  - `charts/`             - Generated visualization files (e.g., PNG charts)
  - `summary/`            - Summary reports in CSV and text formats
- `src/`                   
  - `analysis.py`        - Functions for statistical analysis
  - `config.py`          - Configuration settings and constants
  - `data_processing.py` - Data loading and transformation logic
  - `main.py`            - Main entry point for running the project
  - `utils.py`           - Helper functions for reusable utilities
  - `visualization.py`   - Functions for creating charts
- `README.md`            - Project documentation (this file)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/sales-analysis.git
   cd sales-analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
bashpip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage
1. Place your sales_data.csv file in the data/ folder. The CSV should include columns like product_id, sales_amount, and date.
2. Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```
3. Check the `output/` folder for generated charts (in `charts/`) and summary reports (in `summary`/).

## Example Outputs

### Bar Chart:
Visualizes total sales by product (`output/charts/sales_by_product.png`).
### Line Plot:
Shows sales trends over time (`output/charts/sales_trend.png`).
### Summary Report:
A CSV file with metrics like total sales and average sales per product (`output/summary/sales_summary.csv`).

Technologies Used

## Future Improvements

Add interactive dashboards using Plotly for dynamic data exploration.
Implement sales forecasting with machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).
Automate daily data updates via a scheduling script.
Add unit tests to ensure code reliability.
